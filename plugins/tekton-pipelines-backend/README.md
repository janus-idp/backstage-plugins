# Tekton Pipelines Backend Plugin

This is the Tekton Pipelines Backend part. 

_This plugin was created through the Backstage CLI_

## Getting started

Access the backend  by running `yarn start` in the plugin directory, and then navigating to [/tekton-pipelines-backend](http://localhost:3000/tekton-pipelines-backend).

This method of serving the plugin provides quicker iteration speed and a faster startup and hot reloads.
It is only meant for local development, and the setup for it can be found inside the [/dev](/dev) directory.
