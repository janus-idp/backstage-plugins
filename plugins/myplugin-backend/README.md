Welcome to the myplugin backend plugin!

## Getting started

- Configure Postgres for tcp/ip
Open Postgres conf file for editing:
```bash
sudo vi /var/lib/pgsql/data/pg_hba.conf
```
Add this line:
```bash
host   all             postgres       127.0.0.1/32                          password
```
- Start Postgres server:
