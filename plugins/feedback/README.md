# Feedback Plugin

Feedback plugin is a valuable addition to backstage which allows project managers to get feedbacks for entites in Backstage Catalog.

It is dedicated to simplifying the process of gathering and managing user feedback for service catalog entities. This plugin seamlessly integrates with the [feedback-backend-plugin](../feedback-backend) and extends its capabilities by allowing users to create Jira tickets associated with their feedback.
