 * The watch-deps command is meant to improve iteration speed while working in a large monorepo

 * The command traverses all dependencies of the current package within the monorepo, and starts
 * watching for updates in all those packages. If a change is detected, we stop listening for changes,
 * and instead start up watch mode for that package. Starting watch mode means running the first
 * available yarn script out of "build:watch", "watch", or "build" --watch.
