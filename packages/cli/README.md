# @janus-idp/cli

This package provides a CLI for developing and exporting Backstage plugins as dynamic plugins. It implements a few new commands on top of the @backstage/cli codebase:

- `package export-dynamic plugin` - Exports a Backstage plugin to a dynamic plugin package
- `package package-dynamic-plugins` - Exports a monorepo of Backstage plugins to dynamic plugin packages in a container image
- `package schema` - Print configuration schema for a package
- `package metadata` - Add metadata to a package.json file

This package also has a modified version of the `package start` and `package build` commands that focus on building frontend plugins as well as the Developer Hub frontend app.

## Installation

Install the package via Yarn:

```sh
yarn add @janus-idp/cli
```

## Development

For local development the cli can be used directly, even from other packages in this repo. The `bin/janus-cli` entrypoint contains a switch that will load the implementation from the `src` directory when executed inside this repo.

To try out the command locally, you can execute the following from the parent directory of this repo:

```bash
./packages/cli/bin/janus-cli --help
```
