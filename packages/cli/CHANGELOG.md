     ... omitted dev dependencies ...
  -   "@testing-library/user-event": "^13.1.8",
  +   "@testing-library/user-event": "^14.0.0",
      ... omitted dev dependencies ...
   }
  ```

- Updated dependencies
  - @backstage/config-loader@1.1.0-next.1

## 0.17.0-next.2

### Patch Changes

- 6a341b2d87: build(deps): bump `@spotify/eslint-config-react` from 12.0.0 to 13.0.0
- 4782f9e925: Fixed misleading log message during frontend plugin creation.

## 0.17.0-next.1

### Minor Changes

- 1f7d4763ab: **BREAKING**: Bump the version range of `jest` from `^26.0.1` to `^27.5.1`. You can find the complete list of breaking changes [here](https://github.com/facebook/jest/releases/tag/v27.0.0).

  We strongly recommend to have completed the [package role migration](https://backstage.io/docs/tutorials/package-role-migration) before upgrading to this version, as the package roles are used to automatically determine the testing environment for each package. If you instead want to set an explicit test environment for each package, you can do so for example in the `"jest"` section in `package.json`. The default test environment for all packages is now `node`, which is also the new Jest default.

  Note that one of the breaking changes of Jest 27 is that the `jsdom` environment no longer includes `setImmediate` and `clearImmediate`, which means you might need to update some of your frontend packages. Another notable change is that `jest.useFakeTimers` now defaults to the `'modern'` implementation, which also mocks microtasks.

### Patch Changes

- c54ce828bd: build(deps): bump `eslint-plugin-jest` from 25.3.4 to 26.1.2
- f151dfee5a: build(deps): bump `eslint-webpack-plugin` from 2.6.0 to 3.1.1
- 7e7ba704be: build(deps): bump `@spotify/eslint-config-base` from 12.0.0 to 13.0.0
- ecd72391fb: build(deps): bump `@spotify/eslint-config-typescript`
- 5b3079694e: Stop logging "Stopped watcher" when shutting down the development backend.

## 0.16.1-next.0

### Patch Changes

- 6ad0c45648: Added an experimental `package fix` command which applies automated fixes to the target package. The initial fix that is available is to add missing monorepo dependencies to the target package.
- c47509e1a0: Implemented changes suggested by Deepsource.io including multiple double non-null assertion operators and unexpected awaits for non-promise values.
- 948a56f401: Added a new experimental `repo list-deprecations` command, which scans the entire project for usage of deprecated APIs.
- Updated dependencies
  - @backstage/config-loader@1.0.1-next.0

## 0.16.0

### Minor Changes

- 217547ae51: **BREAKING**: The provided Jest configuration now only matches files with a `.test.` infix, rather than any files that is suffixed with `test.<ext>`. In particular this means that files named just `test.ts` will no longer be considered a test file.

### Patch Changes

- 947ae3b40e: Applied the fix from version `0.15.3` of this package, which is part of the `v0.71.1` release of Backstage.
- 19eed0edd9: Fix for `overrides` not being properly forwarded from the extra configuration passed to `@backstage/cli/config/eslint-factory`.
- f24ef7864e: Minor typo fixes
- Updated dependencies
  - @backstage/config-loader@1.0.0
  - @backstage/config@1.0.0
  - @backstage/errors@1.0.0
  - @backstage/types@1.0.0

## 0.15.3

### Patch Changes

- Fixed an issue where the CLI would try and fail to require the `package.json` of other Backstage packages, like `@backstage/dev-utils/package.json`.

## 0.15.2

### Patch Changes

- 2c528506aa: Added `--since <ref>` flag for `repo build` command.`
- 60799cc5be: build(deps-dev): bump `@types/npm-packlist` from 1.1.2 to 3.0.0
- d3d1b82198: chore(deps): bump `minimatch` from 5.0.0 to 5.0.1
- e0a69ba49f: build(deps): bump `fs-extra` from 9.1.0 to 10.0.1
- 44cc7c3b95: Added a new ESLint configuration setup for packages, which utilizes package roles to generate the correct configuration. The new configuration is available at `@backstage/cli/config/eslint-factory`.

  Introduced a new `backstage-cli migrate package-lint-configs` command, which migrates old lint configurations to use `@backstage/cli/config/eslint-factory`.

- b1aacbf96a: Applied the fix from version `0.15.1` of this package, which was part of the `v0.70.1` release of Backstage.
- d2ecde959b: Package roles are now marked as stable and migration is encouraged. Please check out the [migration guide](https://backstage.io/docs/tutorials/package-role-migration).

  The new `package`, `repo`, and `migrate` command categories are now marked as stable.

  Marked all commands that are being replaced by the new `package` and `repo` commands as deprecated.

  The package templates used by the `create` command have all been updated to use package roles.

- f06da37290: The backend development setup now ignores the `"browser"` and `"module"` entry points in `package.json`, and instead always uses `"main"`.
- 6a1fe077ad: Changed the logic for how modules are marked as external in the Rollup build of packages. Rather than only marking dependencies and build-in Node.js modules as external, all non-relative imports are now considered external.
- dc6002a7b9: The `--since` flag of repo commands now silently falls back to using the provided `ref` directly if no merge base is available.
- Updated dependencies
  - @backstage/config-loader@0.9.7

## 0.15.2-next.0

### Patch Changes

- 2c528506aa: Added `--since <ref>` flag for `repo build` command.`
- d3d1b82198: chore(deps): bump `minimatch` from 5.0.0 to 5.0.1

- Updated dependencies
  - @backstage/config-loader@0.9.7-next.0

## 0.15.1

### Patch Changes

- Fixed an issue where the release stage entry point of packages were not resolved correctly.

## 0.15.0

### Minor Changes

- 8c3f30cb28: **BREAKING**: Removed the deprecated `app.<key>` template variables from the `index.html` templating. These should be replaced by using `config.getString("app.<key>")` instead.

### Patch Changes

- 46a19c599f: The CLI now bundles both version 16 and 17 of the patched `@hot-loader/react-dom` dependency, and selects the appropriate one based on what version of `react-dom` is installed within the app.

## 0.14.1

### Patch Changes

- 5cc7f48400: Fixed a bug in the built-in Jest configuration that prevented it from identifying packages that had migrated to using the new package scripts to run tests.
- 49ae6c9573: chore(deps-dev): bump `@types/rollup-plugin-postcss` from 2.0.1 to 3.1.4
- d64b8d3678: chore(deps): bump `minimatch` from 3.0.4 to 5.0.0
- d2e9d2a34f: chore(deps): bump `@hot-loader/react-dom` from 16.13.0 to 17.0.2
- c2f3a548cf: Fix building of backends with `repo build --all`, where it would previously only work if the build was executed within the backend package.
- 3d7ed5377a: Ignore setupTests and the file inside ./dev folder recursively. Eslint
  can not resolve relative paths as we defined in the rule import/no-extraneous-dependencies, and it does not apply this rule.

  A downside to use a recursive definition would be to checking all `dev` folders, which might not be wanted. Ensure you don't use
  the `dev` folder out of scope (must be used for dev. env. only)

- Updated dependencies
  - @backstage/config-loader@0.9.6

## 0.14.0

### Minor Changes

- 1fc0cd3896: Bumped Webpack and Rollup `svgr` dependencies and updated the AST template for `.icon.svg` modules. This means that SVG icon imports are now using SVGO v2.

### Patch Changes

- 0b74c72987: Added a new experimental and hidden `backstage-cli repo lint` command that can be used to lint all packages in the project, similar to `lerna run lint`.
- 532dae9c4c: The `versions:bump --release next` command is updated to compare the `main` and `next` release manifests and prefer the latest.
- 1ed305728b: Bump `node-fetch` to version 2.6.7 and `cross-fetch` to version 3.1.5
- c77c5c7eb6: Added `backstage.role` to `package.json`
- 22862486de: The `versions:bump` command now filters out `npm_` environment configuration when running `yarn install`. This has the effect of allowing it to consider local configuration files within the repository, which is the behavior that one would expect.
- 22862486de: The `versions:bump` command now also considers the root `package.json` when searching for updates. It has also received updates to its output, including a link the [Backstage upgrade helper](https://backstage.github.io/upgrade-helper) and silenced `yarn install` output.
- 7410e12268: Several changes were made to the new experimental package roles system. Unless you have been experimenting with using this new system, these changes have no affect on your project.

  Renamed the `backstage-cli migrate package-role` command to `backstage-cli migrate package-roles`.

  Updated the package role definitions by renaming `app` to `frontend`, `plugin-frontend` to `frontend-plugin`, `plugin-frontend-module` to `frontend-plugin-module`, `plugin-backend` to `backend-plugin`, and `plugin-backend-module` to `backend-plugin-module`

  The `backstage-cli migrate package-scripts` received several tweaks to make it more accurate. It now tries to maintain existing script arguments, like `--config` parameters for `build` and `start` scripts.

  The `script` command category has been renamed to `package`.

  The `backstage-cli package build` command set an incorrect target directory for `app` and `backend` packages, which has been fixed.

  The `backend:bundle` and `repo build` command for the `backend` role was previously ignoring building of bundled packages that had migrated to use package roles and the standard build script, this has now been fixed.

- c6bbafb516: Updated the default [sucrase](https://github.com/alangpierce/sucrase)-based Jest transform to include source maps if the environment variable `ENABLE_SOURCE_MAPS` is non-empty. This can be used to better support editor test debugging integrations.
- 7410e12268: The `test` command now automatically adds `--passWithNoTests` to the Jest invocation. To revert this behavior, pass `--passWithNoTests=false` or `--no-passWithNoTests`.
- Updated dependencies
  - @backstage/config-loader@0.9.4
  - @backstage/errors@0.2.1
  - @backstage/release-manifests@0.0.2
  - @backstage/cli-common@0.1.7
  - @backstage/config@0.1.14
  - @backstage/types@0.1.2

## 0.13.2

### Patch Changes

- bbbaa8ed61: The `plugin:diff` command no longer validates the existence of any of the files within `dev/` or `src/`.
- eaf67f0578: Introduced initial support for an experimental `backstage.role` field in package.json, as well as experimental and hidden `migrate` and `script` sub-commands. We do not recommend usage of any of these additions yet.
- aeb5c69abb: Introduces a new `--release` parameter to the `backstage-cli versions:bump` command.
  The release can be either a specific version, for example `0.99.1`, or the latest `main` or `next` release.
  The default behavior is to bump to the latest `main` release.
- d59b90852a: The experimental types build enabled by `--experimental-type-build` now runs in a separate worker thread.
- 50a19ff8dd: The file path printed by the default lint formatter is now relative to the repository root, rather than the individual package.
- 63181dee79: Tweaked frontend bundling configuration to avoid leaking declarations into global scope.
- fae2aee878: Removed the `import/no-duplicates` lint rule from the frontend and backend ESLint configurations. This rule is quite expensive to execute and only provides a purely cosmetic benefit, so we opted to remove it from the set of default rules. If you would like to keep this rule you can add it back in your local ESLint configuration:

  ```js
    'import/no-duplicates': 'warn'
  ```

- b906f98119: Rather than calling `yarn pack`, the `build-workspace` and `backend-bundle` commands now move files directly whenever possible. This cuts out several `yarn` invocations and speeds the packing process up by several orders of magnitude.
- d0c71e2aa4: Switched the `lint` command to invoke ESLint directly through its Node.js API rather than spawning a new process.
- d59b90852a: Introduced an experimental and hidden `repo` sub-command, that contains commands that operate on an entire monorepo rather than individual packages.
- Updated dependencies
  - @backstage/release-manifests@0.0.1

## 0.13.1

### Patch Changes

- 5bd0ce9e62: chore(deps): bump `inquirer` from 7.3.3 to 8.2.0
- 80f510caee: Log warning if unable to parse yarn.lock

## 0.13.1-next.1

### Patch Changes

- 5bd0ce9e62: chore(deps): bump `inquirer` from 7.3.3 to 8.2.0

## 0.13.1-next.0

### Patch Changes

- 80f510caee: Log warning if unable to parse yarn.lock

## 0.13.0

### Minor Changes

- 1ddf6d9d5a: Removes the previously deprecated `remove-plugin` command alongside the `--lax` option to `app:build`.

### Patch Changes

- c372a5032f: chore(deps): bump `jest-transform-yaml` from 0.1.1 to 1.0.0
- 1b4ab0d44c: Updated the dependency warning that is baked into `app:serve` to only warn about packages that are not allowed to have duplicates.
- dc46efa2cc: Switched the `WebpackDevServer` configuration to use client-side detection of the WebSocket protocol.
- 10086f5873: Upgraded `webpack`, `webpack-dev-server`,`fork-ts-checker-webpack-plugin`, `react-dev-utils`, and `react-hot-loader`. Since `ForkTsCheckerWebpackPlugin` no longer runs ESLint, we now include the `ESLintPlugin` from `eslint-webpack-plugin` if the `--check` flag is passed.

## 0.12.0

### Minor Changes

- 08fa6a604a: Removed the `typescript` dependency from the Backstage CLI in order to decouple the TypeScript version in Backstage projects. To keep using a specific TypeScript version, be sure to add an explicit dependency in your root `package.json`:

  ```json
    "dependencies": {
      ...
      "typescript": "~4.5.4",
    }
  ```

  We recommend using a `~` version range since TypeScript releases do not adhere to semver.

  It may be the case that you end up with errors if you upgrade the TypeScript version. This is because there was a change to TypeScript not long ago that defaulted the type of errors caught in `catch` blocks to `unknown`. You can work around this by adding `"useUnknownInCatchVariables": false` to the `"compilerOptions"` in your `tsconfig.json`:

  ```json
    "compilerOptions": {
      ...
      "useUnknownInCatchVariables": false
    }
  ```

  Another option is to use the utilities from `@backstage/errors` to assert the type of errors caught in `catch` blocks:

  ```ts
  import { assertError, isError } from '@backstage/errors';

  try {
    ...
  } catch (error) {
    assertError(error);
    ...
    // OR
    if (isError(error)) {
      ...
    }
  }
  ```

  Yet another issue you might run into when upgrading TypeScript is incompatibilities in the types from `react-use`. The error you would run into looks something like this:

  ```plain
  node_modules/react-use/lib/usePermission.d.ts:1:54 - error TS2304: Cannot find name 'DevicePermissionDescriptor'.

  1 declare type PermissionDesc = PermissionDescriptor | DevicePermissionDescriptor | MidiPermissionDescriptor | PushPermissionDescriptor;
  ```

  If you encounter this error, the simplest fix is to replace full imports of `react-use` with more specific ones. For example, the following:

  ```ts
  import { useAsync } from 'react-use';
  ```

  Would be converted into this:

  ```ts
  import useAsync from 'react-use/lib/useAsync';
  ```

### Patch Changes

- 6e34e2cfbf: Introduce `--deprecated` option to `config:check` to log all deprecated app configuration properties

  ```sh
  $ yarn backstage-cli config:check --lax --deprecated
  config:check --lax --deprecated
  Loaded config from app-config.yaml
  The configuration key 'catalog.processors.githubOrg' of app-config.yaml is deprecated and may be removed soon. Configure a GitHub integration instead.
  ```

- f2fe4d240b: Switched to only apply `@hot-loader/react-dom` [Webpack aliasing](https://github.com/hot-loader/react-dom/tree/master/source#webpack) when using React 16.
- 2a42d573d2: Introduced a new `--experimental-type-build` option to the various package build commands. This option switches the type definition build to be executed using API Extractor rather than a `rollup` plugin. In order for this experimental switch to work, you must also have `@microsoft/api-extractor` installed within your project, as it is an optional peer dependency.

  The biggest difference between the existing mode and the experimental one is that rather than just building a single `dist/index.d.ts` file, API Extractor will output `index.d.ts`, `index.beta.d.ts`, and `index.alpha.d.ts`, all in the `dist` directory. Each of these files will have exports from more unstable release stages stripped, meaning that `index.d.ts` will omit all exports marked with `@alpha` or `@beta`, while `index.beta.d.ts` will omit all exports marked with `@alpha`.

  In addition, the `prepack` command now has support for `alphaTypes` and `betaTypes` fields in the `publishConfig` of `package.json`. These optional fields can be pointed to `dist/types.alpha.d.ts` and `dist/types.beta.d.ts` respectively, which will cause `<name>/alpha` and `<name>/beta` entry points to be generated for the package. See the [`@backstage/catalog-model`](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/blob/master/packages/catalog-model/package.json) package for an example of how this can be used in practice.

## 0.10.3

### Patch Changes

- dfc1110dc4: Added peerPluginDependencies option to experimentalInstallationRecipe for install command to install plugins it depends on.
- 58b0262dd9: Pruned unused dependencies.
- 5fdc8df0e8: The frontend configuration is now available as a `config` global during templating of the `index.html` file. This allows for much more flexibility as the values available during templating is not longer hardcoded to a fixed set of values.

  For example, to access the app title, you would now do the following:

  ```html
  <title><%= config.getString('app.title') %></title>
  ```

  Along with this change, usage of the existing `app.<key>` values has been deprecated and will be removed in a future release. The general pattern for migrating existing usage is to replace `<%= app.<key> %>` with `<%= config.getString('app.<key>') %>`, although in some cases you may need to use for example `config.has('app.<key>')` or `config.getOptionalString('app.<key>')` instead.

  The [`@backstage/create-app` changelog](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/blob/master/packages/create-app/CHANGELOG.md#049) also contains more details how to migrate existing usage.

- Updated dependencies
  - @backstage/config-loader@0.9.0

## 0.10.2

### Patch Changes

- 25dfc2d483: Add support for `.cjs` and `.mjs` extensions in local and dependency modules.

## 0.10.1

### Patch Changes

- 0ebb05eee2: Add cli option to minify the generated code of a plugin or backend package

  ```
  backstage-cli plugin:build --minify
  backstage-cli backend:build --minify
  ```

- cd450844f6: Updated the frontend plugin template to put React dependencies in `peerDependencies` by default, as well as allowing both React v16 and v17. This change can be applied to existing plugins by running `yarn backstage-cli plugin:diff` within the plugin package directory.

## 0.10.0

### Minor Changes

- ea99ef5198: Remove the `backend:build-image` command from the CLI and added more deprecation warnings to other deprecated fields like `--lax` and `remove-plugin`

### Patch Changes

- e7230ef814: Bump react-dev-utils to v12
- 416b68675d: build(dependencies): bump `style-loader` from 1.2.1 to 3.3.1
- Updated dependencies
  - @backstage/config-loader@0.8.1

## 0.9.1

### Patch Changes

- dde216acf4: Switch the default test coverage provider from the jest default one to `'v8'`, which provides much better coverage information when using the default Backstage test setup. This is considered a bug fix as the current coverage information is often very inaccurate.
- 719cc87d2f: Disable ES transforms in tests transformed by the `jestSucraseTransform.js`. This is not considered a breaking change since all code is already transpiled this way in the development setup.
- bab752e2b3: Change default port of backend from 7000 to 7007.

  This is due to the AirPlay Receiver process occupying port 7000 and preventing local Backstage instances on MacOS to start.

  You can change the port back to 7000 or any other value by providing an `app-config.yaml` with the following values:

  ```
  backend:
    listen: 0.0.0.0:7123
    baseUrl: http://localhost:7123
  ```

  More information can be found here: https://backstage.io/docs/conf/writing

- 6dcfe227a2: Added a scaffolder backend module template for the `create` command.
- 4ca3542fdd: Fixed a bug where calling `backstage-cli backend:bundle --build-dependencies` with no dependencies to be built would cause all monorepo packages to be built instead.
- 867ea81d15: bump `@rollup/plugin-commonjs` from 17.1.0 to 21.0.1
- 16d06f6ac3: Introduces new `backstage-cli create` command to replace `create-plugin` and make space for creating a wider array of things. The create command also adds a new template for creating isomorphic common plugin packages.

  - @backstage/config-loader@0.7.1

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- b486adb8c6: The Jest configuration that's included with the Backstage CLI has received several changes.

  As a part of migrating to more widespread usage of ESM modules, the default configuration now transforms all source files everywhere, including those within `node_modules`. Due to this change the existing `transformModules` option has been removed and will be ignored. There is also a list of known packages that do not require transforms in the CLI, which will evolve over time. If needed there will also be an option to add packages to this list in the future, but it is not included yet to avoid clutter.

  To counteract the slowdown of the additional transforms that have been introduced, the default configuration has also been reworked to enable caching across different packages. Previously each package in a Backstage monorepo would have its own isolated Jest cache, but it is now shared between packages that have a similar enough Jest configuration.

  Another change that will speed up test execution is that the transformer for `.esm.js` files has been switched. It used to be an ESM transformer based on Babel, but it is also done by sucrase now since it is significantly faster.

  The changes above are not strictly breaking as all tests should still work. It may however cause excessive slowdowns in projects that have configured custom transforms in the `jest` field within `package.json` files. In this case it is either best to consider removing the custom transforms, or overriding the `transformIgnorePatterns` to instead use Jest's default `'/node_modules/'` pattern.

  This change also removes the `@backstage/cli/config/jestEsmTransform.js` transform, which can be replaced by using the `@backstage/cli/config/sucraseEsmTransform.js` transform instead.

### Patch Changes

- 36e67d2f24: Internal updates to apply more strict checks to throw errors.
- Updated dependencies
  - @backstage/config-loader@0.7.0
  - @backstage/errors@0.1.3

## 0.7.16

### Patch Changes

- 53bdc66623: add a --from <location> option to the plugin install command
- 84e24fcdaf: Bump sucrase to version 3.20.2
- 6583c6ac40: Add semicolon in template to make prettier happy
- c6f927d819: Bump mini-css-extract-plugin to v2
- 16f044cb6b: Update default backend ESLint configuration to allow usage of `__dirname` in tests.
- 1ef9e64901: Add an experimental `install <plugin>` command.

  Given a `pluginId`, the command looks for NPM packages matching `@backstage/plugin-{pluginId}` or `backstage-plugin-{pluginId}` or `{pluginId}`. It looks for the `experimentalInstallationRecipe` in their `package.json` for the steps of installation. Detailed documentation and API Spec to follow (and to be decided as well).

## 0.7.15

### Patch Changes

- ae4680b88d: The `create-plugin` command now passes the extension name via the `name` key
  in `createRoutableExtension()` calls in newly created plugins.
- df1242ffe4: Adding `--inspect-brk` as an option when debugging backend for development
- c7f2a2307d: When creating a backend plugin with `--backend` flag, don't add `-backend` if it's already suffixed
- 185fec5c0c: The default jest configuration used by the `test` command now supports yarn workspaces. By running `backstage-cli test` in the root of a monorepo, all packages will now automatically be included in the test suite and it will run just like it does within a package. Each package in the monorepo will still use its own local jest configuration, and only packages that have `backstage-cli test` in the `test` script within `package.json` will be included.
- Updated dependencies
  - @backstage/config-loader@0.6.10
  - @backstage/cli-common@0.1.4

## 0.7.14

### Patch Changes

- 3a8704f16b: Only serve static assets if there is a public folder during `app:serve` and `plugin:serve`. This fixes a common bug that would break `plugin:serve` with an `EBUSY` error.
- 40199b61d6: Configuration schema is now also collected from the root `package.json` if it exists.
- 2a6c393c06: The `create-plugin` command now prefers dependency versions ranges that are already in the lockfile.
- 58f91943ab: Improved ´plugin:diff´ check for the `package.json` `"files"` field.

- Updated dependencies
  - @backstage/config-loader@0.6.9

## 0.7.13

### Patch Changes

- c0c51c9710: Disabled ECMAScript transforms in app and backend builds in order to reduce bundle size and runtime performance. For the rationale and a full list of syntax that is no longer transformed, see https://github.com/alangpierce/sucrase#transforms. This also enables TypeScripts `useDefineForClassFields` flag by default, which in rare occasions could cause build failures. For instructions on how to mitigate issues due to the flag, see the [TypeScript documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-3-7.html#the-usedefineforclassfields-flag-and-the-declare-property-modifier).

## 0.7.6

### Patch Changes

- 9d40fcb1e: - Bumping `material-ui/core` version to at least `4.12.2` as they made some breaking changes in later versions which broke `Pagination` of the `Table`.
  - Switching out `material-table` to `@material-table/core` for support for the later versions of `material-ui/core`
  - This causes a minor API change to `@backstage/core-components` as the interface for `Table` re-exports the `prop` from the underlying `Table` components.
  - `onChangeRowsPerPage` has been renamed to `onRowsPerPageChange`
  - `onChangePage` has been renamed to `onPageChange`
  - Migration guide is here: https://material-table-core.com/docs/breaking-changes

- 48c9fcd33: Migrated to use the new `@backstage/core-*` packages rather than `@backstage/core`.

## 0.7.1

### Patch Changes

- 3108ff7bf: Make `yarn dev` in newly created backend plugins respect the `PLUGIN_PORT` environment variable.

  You can achieve the same in your created backend plugins by making sure to properly call the port and CORS methods on your service builder. Typically in a file named `src/service/standaloneServer.ts` inside your backend plugin package, replace the following:

  ```ts
  const service = createServiceBuilder(module)
    .enableCors({ origin: 'http://localhost:3000' })
    .addRouter('/my-plugin', router);
  ```

  With something like the following:

  ```ts
  let service = createServiceBuilder(module)
    .setPort(options.port)
    .addRouter('/my-plugin', router);
  if (options.enableCors) {
    service = service.enableCors({ origin: 'http://localhost:3000' });
  }
  ```

- Updated dependencies
  - @backstage/config-loader@0.6.4

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- 9cd3c533c: Switch from `ts-jest` to `@sucrase/jest-plugin`, improving performance and aligning transpilation with bundling.

  In order to switch back to `ts-jest`, install `ts-jest@^26.4.3` as a dependency in the root of your repo and add the following in the root `package.json`:

  ```json
  "jest": {
    "globals": {
      "ts-jest": {
        "isolatedModules": true
      }
    },
    "transform": {
      "\\.esm\\.js$": "@backstage/cli/config/jestEsmTransform.js",
      "\\.(js|jsx|ts|tsx)$": "ts-jest",
      "\\.(bmp|gif|jpg|jpeg|png|frag|xml|svg)$": "@backstage/cli/config/jestFileTransform.js",
      "\\.(yaml)$": "yaml-jest"
    }
  }
  ```

  Note that this will override the default jest transforms included with the `@backstage/cli`.

  It is possible that some test code needs a small migration as a result of this change, which stems from a difference in how `sucrase` and `ts-jest` transform module re-exports.

  Consider the following code:

  ```ts
  import * as utils from './utils';

  jest.spyOn(utils, 'myUtility').mockReturnValue(3);
  ```

  If the `./utils` import for example refers to an index file that in turn re-exports from `./utils/myUtility`, you would have to change the code to the following to work around the fact that the exported object from `./utils` ends up not having configurable properties, thus breaking `jest.spyOn`.

  ```ts
  import * as utils from './utils/myUtility';

  jest.spyOn(utils, 'myUtility').mockReturnValue(3);
  ```

### Patch Changes

- 7f7443308: Updated dependencies
- 21e8ebef5: Fix error message formatting in the packaging process.

  error.errors can be undefined which will lead to a TypeError, swallowing the actual error message in the process.

  For instance, if you break your tsconfig.json with invalid syntax, backstage-cli will not be able to build anything and it will be very hard to find out why because the underlying error message is hidden behind a TypeError.

- 6266ddd11: The `yarn backstage-cli app:diff` has been broken since a couple of months. The command to perform updates `yarn backstage-cli versions:bump` prints change logs which seems to be a good replacement for this command.
- Updated dependencies [a1f5e6545]

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- 19fe61c27: We have updated the default `eslint` rules in the `@backstage/cli` package.

  ```diff
  -'@typescript-eslint/no-shadow': 'off',
  -'@typescript-eslint/no-redeclare': 'off',
  +'no-shadow': 'off',
  +'no-redeclare': 'off',
  +'@typescript-eslint/no-shadow': 'error',
  +'@typescript-eslint/no-redeclare': 'error',
  ```

  The rules are documented [here](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-shadow) and [here](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-redeclare).

  This involved a large number of small changes to the code base. When you compile your own code using the CLI, you may also be
  affected. We consider these rules important, and the primary recommendation is to try to update your code according to the
  documentation above. But those that prefer to not enable the rules, or need time to perform the updates, may update their
  local `.eslintrc.js` file(s) in the repo root and/or in individual plugins as they see fit:

  ```js
  module.exports = {
    // ... other declarations
    rules: {
      '@typescript-eslint/no-shadow': 'off',
      '@typescript-eslint/no-redeclare': 'off',
    },
  };
  ```

  Because of the nature of this change, we're unable to provide a grace period for the update :(

### Patch Changes

- 398e1f83e: Update `create-plugin` template to use the new composability API, by switching to exporting a single routable extension component.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 12a56cdfe: We've bumped the `@eslint-typescript` packages to the latest, which now add some additional rules that might cause lint failures.
  The main one which could become an issue is the [no-use-before-define](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-use-before-define) rule.

  Every plugin and app has the ability to override these rules if you want to ignore them for now.

  You can reset back to the default behaviour by using the following in your own `.eslint.js`

  ```js
  rules: {
    'no-use-before-define': 'off'
  }
  ```

  Because of the nature of this change, we're unable to provide a grace period for the update :(

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 1722cb53c: Added support for loading and validating configuration schemas, as well as declaring config visibility through schemas.

  The new `loadConfigSchema` function exported by `@backstage/config-loader` allows for the collection and merging of configuration schemas from all nearby dependencies of the project.

  A configuration schema is declared using the `https://backstage.io/schema/config-v1` JSON Schema meta schema, which is based on draft07. The only difference to the draft07 schema is the custom `visibility` keyword, which is used to indicate whether the given config value should be visible in the frontend or not. The possible values are `frontend`, `backend`, and `secret`, where `backend` is the default. A visibility of `secret` has the same scope at runtime, but it will be treated with more care in certain contexts, and defining both `frontend` and `secret` for the same value in two different schemas will result in an error during schema merging.

  Packages that wish to contribute configuration schema should declare it in a root `"configSchema"` field in `package.json`. The field can either contain an inlined JSON schema, or a relative path to a schema file. Schema files can be in either `.json` or `.d.ts` format.

  TypeScript configuration schema files should export a single `Config` type, for example:

  ```ts
  export interface Config {
    app: {
      /**
       * Frontend root URL
       * @visibility frontend
       */
      baseUrl: string;
    };
  }
  ```

- 902340451: Support specifying listen host/port for frontend
- Updated dependencies [1722cb53c]

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 28edd7d29: Create backend plugin through CLI
- 1d0aec70f: Upgrade dependency `esbuild@0.7.7`
- 72f6cda35: Adds a new `BACKSTAGE_CLI_BUILD_PARELLEL` environment variable to control
  parallelism for some build steps.

  This is useful in CI to help avoid out of memory issues when using `terser`. The
  `BACKSTAGE_CLI_BUILD_PARELLEL` environment variable can be set to
  `true | false | [integer]` to override the default behaviour. See
  [terser-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/terser-webpack-plugin#parallel)
  for more details.

- 8c2b76e45: **BREAKING CHANGE**

  The existing loading of additional config files like `app-config.development.yaml` using APP_ENV or NODE_ENV has been removed.
  Instead, the CLI and backend process now accept one or more `--config` flags to load config files.

  Without passing any flags, `app-config.yaml` and, if it exists, `app-config.local.yaml` will be loaded.
  If passing any `--config <path>` flags, only those files will be loaded, **NOT** the default `app-config.yaml` one.

  The old behaviour of for example `APP_ENV=development` can be replicated using the following flags:

  ```bash
  --config ../../app-config.yaml --config ../../app-config.development.yaml
  ```

- 8afce088a: Use APP_ENV before NODE_ENV for determining what config to load
