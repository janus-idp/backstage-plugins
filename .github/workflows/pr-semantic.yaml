          # from GitHub. However, private repositories on the free plan don't have
          # this option and therefore this action allows you to opt-in to using the

          # validation of the PR title and the pull request checks remain pending.

            Hey there and thank you for opening this pull request! 👋🏼

            We require pull request titles to follow the [Conventional Commits specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) and it looks like your proposed title needs to be adjusted.

            Details:

            ```
            ${{ steps.lint_pr_title.outputs.error_message }}
            ```
