Backstage is a single-page application composed of a set of plugins. This repository holds all plugins that are maintained, developed, and managed by the Janus IDP project.

For more information about the plugin ecosystem, see the upstream [documentation](https://backstage.io/docs/plugins/).

A subset of available Janus IDP plugins is available at our [community site](https://janus-idp.io/plugins).

You can also see the [Plugin Marketplace](https://backstage.io/plugins) for other open-source plugins you can add to your Backstage instance.
